# Research Methods - R workshop
# -----------------------------
#
# 18 participants (9 female, 9 male) were given one of three possible dosages 
# of a drug. They were all tested on recall for three types of words (negative, 
# neutral, positive), using two distinct memory tasks.
#
# The data contains variables for:
#       - Gender: Female (F), Male (M)
#       - Dosage: A, B, C
#       - Task: Cued recall (C), Free recall (F)
#
# The scores for recall are shown for each category of word valence:
#       - Negative (neg), Neutral (neu), Positive (pos)
#
# In this workshop, you are asked to:
#       - Calculate the average scores for each dosage of the drug
#       - Create a histogram for the overall scores
#       - Assess the effects of gender, task, valence, and dosage on scores
#       - Plot the results
#
# You should expect to find the following results:
#       - Average scores:
#           - Dosage A: 14.19
#           - Dosage B: 13.5
#           - Dosage C: 19.19
#       - Main effects:
#           - Gender: F = 5.685, p = .034
#           - Task: F = 39.862, p < .001
